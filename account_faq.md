# FAQs
{: #accountfaqs}

## Which {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions can I use?
{: #whichregions}

In a Lite account, you can work in only one region. In a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can access all regions.

## What's a Lite pricing plan for services?
{: #whatisliteplan}

A Lite plan is a free quota-based service plan. You can use a service Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle (renewed each month) or on a one-off usage basis. You can have one instance per Lite plan service. Lite pricing plans are offered in all accounts.

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}

In a Lite account your apps can access up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you have used the available Lite account allowance. If you need additional memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use past that. There are no limits to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.

# Standard account FAQ 
{: #stdaccountfaq}

The following frequently asked questions relate to a Standard account, which is created in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} public cloud.

## Who can sign up for a Standard account?
{: #whocanuse}

Because it is in limited release, only a select few new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} users in the United Kingdom and the United States are eligible for a Standard account. Users can also sign up for a Standard account if they receive an invite from a user participating in the limited release. You can ask a friend who already has a Standard account to invite you, or get in touch with our sales team at sales@bluemix.net.

## How many organizations can I use in a Standard account?
{: #howmanyorgs}

Because the Standard account is not meant for advanced use cases, it is limited to one account. If you need more than one organization, you can upgrade to a billable account and pay only for what you use above the free allowances. For more information, see [Signing up for a billable account](/docs/pricing/billable.html#billable).

## Does a Standard account ever expire?
{: #neverexpires}
   
No it does not expire - you can use the free Standard account for as long as you need it. At some point, you might want to use infrastructure resources or other services that don't have a Lite plan. Then, you can upgrade to a billable account. 

## Can I invite others to collaborate in my Standard account?
{: #inviteothers}

Yes, you can invite friends and colleagues to work with you on your projects in your account. In your Standard account, to invite other users click **Manage** &gt; **Account** &gt; **Users** &gt; **Invite users** and complete the relevant details.  

## Which Bluemix regions can I use?
{: #whichregions}

In a Standard account you can work in only one region. When you set up your account and log in for the first time, you can select which {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region you want to work in. You can access all regions in a billable account.

## Which Bluemix resources can I use in a Standard account?
{: #whichservices}

All services that provide a Lite plan can be used in a Standard account. Currently, the following services have a Lite plan:

<ul>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.prf_hublong}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.iot_full}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzerfull}}</li>
</ul>

Some services are not available in all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions. For more information, see [Services by region](/docs/services/services_region.html#services_region).

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also provides the following ways for you to run your apps in a Standard account:
<ul>
<li>Cloud Foundry</li>
<li>Kubernetes clusters</li>
</ul>

More catalog resources will be added to this list, watch this space! 

## What's a Lite plan?
{: #whatisliteplan}

A Lite plan is a free quota based service plan. You can use a service Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle (renewed each month) or on a one-off usage basis. You can have 1 instance per Lite plan service.  

## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}

In a Standard account your apps can access up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you have used up the available Standard account allowance. If you need additional memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use past that.

## What happens if I don't use my Standard account?
{: #inactiveaccount}

If you are not actively developing in your account for a period of 10 days, your apps will go to sleep. After 30 days of inactivity, your Lite plan services will be deleted. This saves you time and effort when you start developing apps again, because you won't have to delete apps to free up space.

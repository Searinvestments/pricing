# Applying feature codes
{: #codes}

Sometimes {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Sales or other representatives provide feature codes to offer you extra resources or capabilities for your trial or Standard account.

The extra resources or capabilities provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} vary depending on the particular code,
but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB specified by the promo code
  * Add one organization, with a memory quota that is specified by the promo code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an additional number of SSL certificates, as specified by the promo code
  * Use premium service plans

To apply one or more feature codes:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing**.
2. Enter the feature code details and click **Apply feature code**.

Each feature code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date.

# Applying feature (promo) codes
{: #codes}

Sometimes {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Sales or other representatives provide feature codes, previously known as promo codes, to offer you extra resources or capabilities for your Lite or trial account. While we recently renamed promo codes to features codes, you can still use them to unlock additional {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} capabilities.
{: shortdesc}

The extra resources or capabilities provided by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} vary depending on the particular code,
but include one or more of the following items in general:

  * Increase the memory quota to a number of GB specified by the code
  * Add one organization, with a memory quota that is specified by the code
  * Add an unlimited number of organizations
  * Upload an additional number of SSL certificates, as specified by the code
  * Use premium service plans

To apply a code:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and Usage > Billing**.
2. Enter the feature code details and click **Apply code**.

Each  code can be redeemed only once before the code's expiration date.

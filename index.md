# Account types
{: #bmaccounts}

You can start building on IBM Bluemix for free. When you are ready to grow, you can upgrade and pay only for what you use beyond free allowances. Bluemix provides a cost calculator, which you can use to estimate the cost beforehand. Check the Usage Dashboard page in your Bluemix account to see the actual cost after you build your apps.

* Maximum 2 GB memory
* 10 services
* 1 SSL certificate

### What happens when my free trial ends? 
{: #trialend}

When your free trial expires 30 days after you sign up, the apps in your account are stopped. You can't sign up for another {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} trial, but you can still access your account and any accounts that you are invited to. 

To restart your apps, convert your account to a pay account - either provide your credit card information for a Pay-As-You-Go account or create a Subscription account. You can then continue to use free compute and service allowances. You pay only for the usage of services, containers, and runtimes that's not included in your free monthly allowance.

If you don't convert your account after your free trial expires, you'll receive email notifications to remind you to create a billable account and avoid losing your app settings and service configurations. If you prefer not to receive notifications from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can unsubscribe at any time.

When your trial expires, if you don't upgrade, your apps and service configurations are removed after 30 days. However, your account is not deleted and you can log in and upgrade to a billable account at any time. 

If you convert your account during your free trial, your free allowances are limited to allowances normally provided by each service. The allowances are no longer unlimited use allowances that are offered by many of the IBM services during the free trial.

# Account types
{: #accounts}

You can start building on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} for free. When you are ready to grow, upgrade and pay only for what you use beyond free allowances. We have four different account types that you can choose from: Lite, Pay-As-You-Go, Subscription, and Trial. You can use any of the account types to get started in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - simply choose the one that best suits your needs.

## Trial account
{: #Trial}

Trial accounts are available in all regions. With a free 30-day trial, you can jump right in and start building your apps and exploring services in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. 

When you sign up for a free trial with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} ID, your account is provided with the following resources, free of charge:

  * Maximum 2 GB memory
  * 10 services
  * 1 SSL certificate

### What happens when my free trial ends?
{: #trialend}

When your free trial expires 30 days after you sign up, the apps in your account are stopped. You can't sign up for another {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account, but you can still access your account and any accounts that you are invited to.

To restart your apps, convert your account to a billable account by either providing your credit card information for a Pay-As-You-Go account or creating a Subscription account. You can then continue to use free compute and service allowances. You pay only for the usage of services, containers, and runtimes that's not included in your free monthly allowance.

If you don't convert your account after your free trial expires, your apps and services are removed after 30 days. However, your account is not deleted and you can log in and upgrade to a billable account at any time. Also, you receive email notifications to remind you to create a billable account and avoid losing your app settings and service configurations. If you prefer not to receive notifications from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can unsubscribe at any time.

If you convert your account, your free allowances are limited to allowances normally provided by each service. The allowances are no longer unlimited use allowances that are offered by many of the IBM services during the free trial.

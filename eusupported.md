# Enabling the EU supported option
{: #bill_eusupported}

The EU Supported section on the Billing window shows whether you have chosen to limit support of any {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} resources that you use in Europe to support teams residing in Europe. You might choose to enable the EU Supported option, for example, if you use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources to process personal data for European citizens. The EU Supported option is available with all paid plans.

If you are an account owner, a master user, or have been designated by a master user, you can enable the option using the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, click **Manage** > **Billing and Usage** > **Billing** to access the Billing window.  
2. If the **EU Supported** option is shown as **Off**, click **Turn on**.
3. Read the information about the EU Supported option.
4. Select **I understand and agree to these terms**.
5. Click **Turn on**.

Selecting the EU supported option limits Level 1 and Level 2 support to be provided by support team members in the EU region, however, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} teams outside the EU region might perform processing activities. Global teams might be contacted when issues are not resolved by the Level 1 or Level 2 support teams in the EU, but always at the instruction of the EU support team and only when there is no impact to the security or privacy of your data.

Selecting this option also enables EU supported services with strict access controls to ensure that the data you store and process is restricted to and controlled by the IBM support team in the EU region. If {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} experts outside of the European region require access to this data to support or operate the cloud, an EU support team member reviews the access request. If access is necessary, the EU support team member provides access to the global cloud expert only to the requested system, and only for a specific time frame after which access is revoked. Throughout this process, your data is always protected.

After you set the EU Supported option for your account, you can create services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog that are *EU Supported*. When you create the service instance, select a European region to create the service as *EU-Supported*.

For more information about setting the EU Supported option when you create support tickets, and for a list of services that are EU supported, see [Requesting support for resources in the European Union](/docs/support/index.html#eusupported).

If you are using {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} infrastructure and you do not have a linked SoftLayer account, you set the EU Supported option in the Account Profile window of the customer portal. For more information, see [Setting the EU Supported option](/docs/customer-portal/cpmanuserprof.html#cp_seteusupported).

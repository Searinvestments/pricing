# Accessing infrastructure resources
{: #accessinfrastructure}

When you are building your apps in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} public cloud you can use infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources, which are listed in the Infrastructure dashboard. 
IaaS resources can be used to build virtual environments, provide storage, establish a network, and secure your environment. For more information, see [Infrastructure](/docs/overview/whatisbluemix.html#bluemixoverviewinfrastructure). 

Not every {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} billable account can access the Infrastructure dashboard. To access the IaaS resources you must have a Pay-As-You-Go account. For more information, see [Signing up for a billable account](/docs/pricing/billable.html). 

To outline the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} accounts that are available in the public cloud, the following table lists the different accounts and explains what you need to do to access the Infrastructure dashboard. 

|{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account type |	Infrastructure dashboard access? |	What are my options? |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
|Free account (Lite or trial) |	No access |	Upgrade your free account to a Pay-As-You-Go account. |
|Pay-As-You-Go account | Yes, if your account was created after 24 October 2016 | Nothing else is required. | 
| | No access, if your account was created before 24 October 2016 | Add your credit card details again to access the Infrastructure dashboard. |
|Subscription account |	No access |	Create a separate Pay-As-You-Go account with a different email address to the email address that is associated to your Subscription account. Each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account must have a unique email address associated with it. You are billed separately for your Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts. |
